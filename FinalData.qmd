## Import Dataset

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
library(readr)
library(utf8)

# Check the encoding of the CSV file
file_encoding <- guess_encoding("week7_starwars.csv")$encoding
cat("File Encoding:", file_encoding, "\n")

# Read CSV file and convert strings to UTF-8 encoding
starwars <- read_csv("week7_starwars.csv", locale = locale(encoding = file_encoding)) %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.character), utf8_encode))

# Use skim on the dataframe
skim(starwars)
```

I don't think pivoting is super necessary, since every row is a separate person who responded.

The variable types in each column seem to be good. Most are char.

I need to remove some NAs using R code.

Fixing column names are necessary because they are full questions with spaces, so I need to shorten them and remove spaces.
