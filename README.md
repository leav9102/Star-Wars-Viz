# Overview
R project for a visualization showing that the favorability of Darth Vader is much higher for people who viewed Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. In this repository contains a "FinalData" quarto document and knitted pdf and a "FinalProject" quarto document and knitted pdf. The "FinalData" file implements R data cleaning and preparation methods to prepare the large Star Wars csv containing survey data for use. The "FinalProject" file loads the cleaned data and produces a detailed and thoughtful visualization for the survey results. Pdf files in this folder provide accessible viewing for R quarto script output. Finally, there is a metadata file, explaining methodology, data, and project inspiration.

# Project Guidelines
This project aims to use a dataset, and create a fun or interesting visualization with it. I was required to make a presentable, and I did this in the form of an oral presentation. We then had to submit our "behind the scenes" quarto files to show our methodology and step-by-step inputs and outputs. The pdfs show behind the scenes without needing to download the quarto markdown files. Finally, we were required to write a metadata document, explaining our methodology, data, and project inspiration. In the end, this project improved my technical, visualization, oral, and writing skills, all while producing an interesting visualization.

# Setup and Use
